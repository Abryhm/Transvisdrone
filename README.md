# Processing NPS Dataset
Download annotations from [Dogfight Github](https://github.com/mwaseema/Drone-Detection?tab=readme-ov-file#annotations) understand the annotation format.
Download the videos from Original [NPS site](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~bouman/UAV_Dataset/)
## Step 1: 
<strong>For the NPS dataset </strong>
Extract all the frames and masks by using the "video_to_frames_and masks.py" .<be>
## Step 2 : 
By using the file "map_masks_images.py," convert the masks into YOLO.txt  format. 
## Step 3 :
Rename and order the names of the frames and labels images by using "reorder_images_labels.py".
## Step 4: 
Rename the images and labels from "000xxx.png" to "00xxx.png" by using the "rename_images_labels.py".

[Convert visdrone to yolov5 style](./conversion_scripts/VisDrone_original_2YOLO_lable.py) Please change the root paths accordingly.
Train, Val, Test split followed as in [dogfight paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.17242.pdf). However contrary to dogfight we don't only use every 4th frame but all the frames in training & testing.
## Step3:
After following Step 1 & Step2 data folder should look like /home/tu666280/NPS-Data-Uncompressed/AllFrames/{train, test, val} for annotations /home/tu666280/NPSvisdroneStyle/{train/labels, val/labels, test/labels} you can keep the root folder same as long as frame & annotation indices are matching. Create a new folder like this /home/tu666280/NPS/Videos/{train, val, test} & symlink your original videos or create video_length_dict.pkl with python dictionary format as {"int(video_id)" such as 1,2 : int(num_frames)}

Finally make into the format of [NPS.yaml](./data/NPS.yaml) where there are train & val folders containing frames in Clip_{id}_{frame_id.zfill(5)}.png & annotations in the format of Clip_{id}_{frame_id.zfill(5)}.txt in yolov5 format.
Videos folder with either videos symlinks in it or video_length_dict.pkl where its a python dictionary stored in {"int(video_id)": "int(num_frames)"}.

# Processing FL-drones dataset

Download fl-drones dataset annotations as described [above](#processing-nps-daataset).
Fl-drones dataset is not publicly available & needs to be obtained from permission with authors. I obtained it as our research collaborater had obtained prior permission.
For each video half the frames are in training & rest are in validation or testing. There's no test section of this dataset. Validation is testing & we don't do cross-validation style training. 
<a name="step-1-fl-drones"> </a>
## Step1 :
[Convert fl-drones annotations to Visdrone style.](./conversion_scripts/fl_drones_to_visdrone.py)

## Step2 :
If annotations are not in yolov5 format then run [convert to yolov5 script](./conversion_scripts/VisDrone2YOLO_lable_fl_drone.py)

## Step 3:
Videos folder will be generated by [Step-1](#step-1-fl-drones).

Finally make into the format of [FLDrone.yaml](./data/FLDrone.yaml) where there are train & val folders containing frames in Clip_{id}_{frame_id.zfill(5)}.png & annotations in the format of Clip_{id}_{frame_id.zfill(5)}.txt in yolov5 format.
Videos folder with either videos symlinks in it or video_length_dict.pkl where its a python dictionary stored in {"int(video_id)": "int(num_frames)"}.

# Processing AOT
Coming soon.
Download the AOT dataset there are three parts, 1st part should suffice for running my experiements. 
1. Link to understand the AOT dataset: [Challenge](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/airborne-object-tracking-challenge#dataset)
2. [Starter Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1B5Gevpg6GIlfMRRfiG79V8Foz13_ncUr#scrollTo=exempt-heath) you need to clone [http://gitlab.aicrowd.com/amazon-prime-air/airborne-detection-starter-kit.git](http://gitlab.aicrowd.com/amazon-prime-air/airborne-detection-starter-kit.git) you can download flight by flight, keep partial=False & download all flights in part1.
Starter kit is already present in the folder [aotcore](./aotcore/), I renamed core folder in the starter kit as aotcore.
3. Or you can download all files on this [s3 bucket](https://registry.opendata.aws/airborne-object-tracking/)
4. Suppose you save entire part1 in `dataset_root = /home/c3-0/datasets/Amazon-AOT/data/part1`
5. `cp conversion_scripts/aot_to_visdrone.py ./` copy aot_to_visdrone.py outside in main root folder & 
6. Set variables `dataset_root` & `aot_yolo_root_dir` in the file `aot_to_visdrone.py`. It will create symlinks from locally downloaded files at `dataset_root` to destination folder `aot_yolo_root_dir` this destination folder will be used in training & testing. Test spilts are created to speedup testing parallely, if not required you can consider clustering all test flights in same yaml file by changing the setting in `aot_to_visdrone.py`.
7. Run `python aot_to_visdrone.py` such that `aot_to_visdrone.py`, `aotcore` & `aot_flight_ids` are all in same directory. If some path issues occur consider exporting aotcore path.
8. For training create [`AOT.yaml`](./data/AOT.yaml) like shown in `data/AOT.yaml` changing appropriate paths
9. To run training refer to comments in [submit-train.slurm](./submit-train.slurm) `python train.py --img 1280 --adam --batch 4 --epochs 80 --data ./data/AOT.yaml --weights ./pretrained/yolo5l.pt \
--hy ./data/hyps/hyp.VisDrone_1.yaml --cfg ./models/yolov5l-xl.yaml --project ./runs/train/AOT \
--name image_size_1280_YOLOXL_1_frames_SwinTR_AOT_with_yolo_weights --exist-ok`
10. Above command will run training for 1 frame model, to run for 3 frames change `--hy ./data/hyps/hyp.Visdrone_3.yaml` for 5 frames change it to `--hy ./data/hyps/hyp.Visdrone.yaml`, also note that above training requires 2 GPUs with 49 GB VRAM capacity
11. For testing refer to comments in [sumbit-test.slurm](./submit-test.slurm) `python val.py --data ./data/AOTTestSplits/AOTTest_$SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID.yaml \
 --weights ./runs/train/AOT/image_size_1280_temporal_SwinTR_1_frames_AOT_with_yolo_weights/weights/best.pt \
 --batch-size 5 --img 1280 --num-frames 1 \
 --project ./runs/val/AOT/image_size_1280_temporal_SwinTR_1_frames_AOT_with_yolo_weights --name best \
 --task test --exist-ok --save-aot-predictions --save-json-gt` this should be launched on 8 == No.of AOT test splits we created gpus simultaneously, each gpu should be of capacity 24 GB VRAM, test if it can work with smaller VRAM as well, reduce batch_size maybe.
 12. Finally run `python evaluate_aot.py --results_folder ./runs/val/AOTtest/epoch_17/aotpredictions --evaluation_folder /some/destination/folder --detection_threshold 0.2` to get AOT challenge metrics evaluated. This needs the path to the folder where your AOT predictions are stored, in step 11.   




# Training NPS, FL-drones & AOT
Please follow whatever parameters are set in submit-train.slurm & submit-test.slurm. In training ``` ampere in SBATCH``` refers to 42 gb NVIDIA ampere gpu.
AOT training requires 2 of those. All the dataset trainings are commented in submit-train.slurm file. Uncomment as per your need, only modify ``` --data flag with updated {NPS, FLDrone, AOT}.yaml with your respective data paths ```.

# Running pre-trained checkpoints
Please follow runs/train/NPS/*/weights, runs/FL/*/weights, runs/AOT/*/weights todownload the weights files.
While best runs are saved in runs/val/*

# Evaluate AOT results
AOT results can't only be evaluated using COCO criteria, it has its own grading criteria.
To run evaluation, save all the predictions & run evaluate_aot.py with given arguments.
To fasten up the evaluation, I split up AOT test data in chunks, get predictions parallely using SBATCH Array & then fuse all the predictions in one.
